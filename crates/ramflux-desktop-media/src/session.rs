//! What the engine needs to carry one call: where to send (the relay
//! allocation), how to present itself there (this side's opaque allocation
//! token), how to move its binding when its address changes (this side's
//! rebind credential, see [`crate::rebind`]), and the SFrame keys of both
//! directions.
//!
//! The daemon hands this out once per call (`call.media.session`): keys
//! never leave the end-to-end encrypted channel the daemon received them
//! on and the engine's memory; they are wiped when dropped and never
//! printed.
//!
//! Each SFrame base key starts exactly once, at counter zero (RFC 9605
//! §4.4.3: a nonce is the salt XOR the counter, so a second sender on the
//! same key would repeat nonces). So a session is not `Clone`, the engine
//! consumes it, and its sending key can be taken once
//! ([`MediaSession::take_send_key`]): there is no way to start a second
//! sender on it. An engine that stops (or fails) is not restarted with the
//! same session; a fresh call brings fresh keys.
